# Convert to Telerik Application

This article demonstrates how to enable the Progress&reg; Telerik&reg; UI for Blazor components in you existing Blazor app with a few mouse clicks.

To add the Telerik Components to you existing Blazor application, use the use the **Convert Project Wizard**. The wizard detects all installed versions of Telerik UI for Blazor and lists them in the **Version** combobox&mdash;this enables you to start your project with the desired version. You can also [get the latest version]({%slug getting-started-vs-integration-latest-version%}) to make sure you are up to date.

To start the wizard, do the following:

1. In the **Solution Explorer**, select the Blazor app you want to add the Telerik components to (either WebAssembly, or Server-side Blazor)
1. Open the **Extensions** menu.
1. Click **Telerik** > **Telerik UI for Blazor** > **Concert to Telerik Application**.
1. Follow the wizard.

The wizard, basically, adds the information from the [What You Need]({%slug getting-started/what-you-need%}) article to your project.
