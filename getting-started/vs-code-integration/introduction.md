# Visual Studio Code Integration Overview

The Progress&reg; Telerik&reg; UI for Blazor Visual Studio Code Extension enhances the experience in developing Blazor web applications with Telerik UI for Blazor.

As its primary advantage, the VS Code extension facilitate the creation of projects through a wizard directly in Visual Studio Code.

You can get the extention from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blazor.templatewizard)

To create a Telerik-enabled Blazor project:

1. Press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` in Windows/Linux or `Cmd`+`Shift`+`P` on Mac to open VSCode's extension launcher

1. Type/Select `Telerik UI for Blazor Template Wizard: Launch` and press `Enter` to launch the extension

1. The wizard will now guide you through the project creation process: choosing a project name and location, the type of project (WASM or Server-side), adding some sample pages to get you started and choosing a Theme.

1. Open the terminal and execute `dotnet run` on the `Server` project.
