# Telerik® UI for Blazor Documentation

Welcome to the GitHub repo for [UI for Blazor](https://www.telerik.com/products/blazor) documentation. This repository contains the source content — written in Markdown — that we use to power Telerik® UI for Blazor Documentation at [http://docs.telerik.com/blazor/introduction](http://docs.telerik.com/blazor/introduction). If you've arrived here wanting to search and peruse our docs, you'd be better served heading over to [http://docs.telerik.com/blazor/introduction](http://docs.telerik.com/blazor/introduction) where our content is prettified and searchable.

## Running Locally

You can generate a static web site from the Telerik® UI for Blazor documentation and browse it locally.

1. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:telerik/blazor-docs.git`
2. Go to the [https://github.com/telerik/docs-seed](https://github.com/telerik/docs-seed) repo and follow the instructions from its own readme file

If you want to keep the local documentation alive after closing the prompt, you can add the `_site` folder that was generated to a server of your choice. Make sure that it is under a path like `serverName/blazor`. You can find sample instructions in the following page, and they are applicable for IIS, even though they are written for the UI for ASP.NET AJAX docs that have two folders nested: [https://github.com/telerik/ajax-docs/wiki/Deploying-Documentation-on-IIS](https://github.com/telerik/ajax-docs/wiki/Deploying-Documentation-on-IIS).
