# Telerik® UI for Blazor Documentation

Welcome to the GitHub repo for [UI for Blazor](https://www.telerik.com/products/blazor) documentation. This repository contains the source content — written in Markdown — that we use to power Telerik® UI for Blazor Documentation at [http://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/introduction](http://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/introduction).

If you've arrived here wanting to search and peruse our docs, you'd be better served heading over to [http://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/introduction](http://docs.telerik.com/blazor-ui/introduction) where our content is prettified and searchable.

**Pull Requests are welcome!** If you see mistakes or missing info, fix it in a PR (you may need to fork the repo for something larger than a typo you can fix online), **or open an Issue**. This will help everyone have better documentation.

## Offline PDF Version

You can download a PDF with this documentation from your telerik.com account. Go to the Downloads section, navigate to UI for Blazor, choose the version you want from the dropdown, and get the PDF file under the Documentation section.

## Running Locally

You can generate a static web site from the Telerik® UI for Blazor documentation and browse it locally.

1. Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:telerik/blazor-docs.git`
2. Go to the [https://github.com/telerik/docs-seed](https://github.com/telerik/docs-seed) repo and follow the instructions from its own readme file

If you want to keep the local documentation alive after closing the prompt, you can add the `_site` folder that was generated to a server of your choice. Make sure that it is under a path like `serverName/blazor-ui`. You can find sample instructions in the following page, and they are applicable for IIS, even though they are written for the UI for ASP.NET AJAX docs where have two folders nested: [https://github.com/telerik/ajax-docs/wiki/Deploying-Documentation-on-IIS](https://github.com/telerik/ajax-docs/wiki/Deploying-Documentation-on-IIS).
