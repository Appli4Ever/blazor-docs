# Keyboard Navigation

The Telerik UI for Blazor components support keyboard navigation so the end users can use the keyboard to walk through them and invoke actions such as clicking buttons, paging the grid and so on.

Generally, to focus a component use the `Tab` key as the keyboard support of the page follows the normal flow of the content. Once in a component, you can use specific keyboard shortcuts to trigger specific actions (such as using the arrow keys to focus different cells in the grid, or the `Enter` key to click a button).

The following list shows the components that support specific keyboard combinations and links to live demos where you can see the behavior in action, together with the available keyboard shortcuts:

*  Button

*  Calendar

*  Chart - not applicable, the chart is a visualization component only

*  ComboBox
