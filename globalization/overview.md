# Globalization Overview

Internationalization (I18N) is the process of making an app support different languages and regions. In the Telerik UI for Blazor suite, this will consist of the following features:

* [Localization (L10N)]({%slug globalization-localization%}) - the ability to show texts and UI elements in the components in different languages (such as button texts and ARIA attributes).
* **Globalization (G11N)** - the ability to react to the chosen culture where format strings are involved (such as number and date formats). This feature will become available in an upcoming release.
* **Right-to-Left Support** - the ability to render the components in a right-to-left direction instead of the default left-to-right direction. This feature will become available in an upcoming release.
