# Breaking Changes in 1.3.0

In the `1.3.0` release, the new `<TelerikRootComponent>` must be added to the root of the application.

It is required for rendering detached popup elements so they can have correct (expected) positions and overflow behavior. You can read more about it in the [What You Need: Project Configuration]({%slug getting-started/what-you-need%}#project-configuration) article.
